- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DoubleSeven-77
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming, networking and engineering.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and studying Computer Engineering.


Some of my skills are:

-Programming in Java, and other object-oriented programming languages such as C++.

-Socket programming (with java.net library).


Most of the time, I work in linux environment (Ubuntu) with GNOME 3.0. I am also a power user, so I can use command line with comfort and write
bash shell scripts to automate tasks which are done manually by default.

I have written many mini-projects in Java, as well as in C++.


I am still learning/studying...
